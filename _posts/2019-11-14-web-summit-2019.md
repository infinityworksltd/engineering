This November, I attended Web Summit in Lisbon with a few of my colleagues from our various Infinity Works locations. This is the largest tech event in the world, with over 70,000 attendees and it was an inspiring week with a broad spread of subjects and some thought provoking speakers. Plus it was great to spend some time sharing experiences and ideas with my fellow Infinity Workers over a beer. These were some of the highlights for me.
