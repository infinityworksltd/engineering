The days of imposing an Enterprise Architecture top down are gone. It doesn’t scale and it doesn’t create good architectures. Now it’s all about building the right culture and community, effecting architectural change through organisational change, and creating generative feedback mechanisms which cause sustainable architectures to grow. Instead of cost reduction we focus on maximising customer value and organisational resilience. Build communities. Optimise for flow, not control. Decide by learning, and learn by doing. Good architectures grow from small and simple beginnings.
