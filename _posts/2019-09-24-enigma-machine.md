# A short Center Parcs story of Enigma

At the annual InfinityWorks conference every year, we try and bring something new and interesting 'to the stage' (literally) and this year, given how much we'd grown, we realised that the standard trope of the directors standing on the stage and using our annual conference as a golden opportunity to mock various members of the organisation just simply doesn't scale to a room of 200 people.

We decided therefore that this year, we should make our conference an actual conference.  We had 16 speakers with various masters of ceremonies to introduce them, culminating in a spectacular talk from Jamie Andrew about the challanges he faced in coping with challange and change. 

The theme of the conference was therefore suitably: "Embracing Change and Ambiguity".  The conference started off with a bang, with our very own CTO Dan Rathbone giving an excellent keynote about the alternative history of InfintiyWorks and how we started, leading now to a brand new InfinityWorks meme for "Seizing the Fish" (perhaps you had to be there).

I was given the opportunity to speak at this years conference, and given my general desire to push the boat out, I thought rather than deliver a talk about some technical or client challange, I would give a talk about a subject I knew almost nothing about - requiring me to learn a great deal in the 2 weeks before the conference!

My talk started with a startling shout of "Careless talk costs lives" - I absolutely love these posters and truly believe we should frame them up around the office.

The story begins with a trip to Bletchley park I made with my wife our (then) 6-month-old daughter and my brother and father.

Just as the title slide says, let's get into how enigma works.

This then is the fundamental overview of an Enigma and the components therein

Let's get on it therefore, and work out how to setup an Enigma machine


![]({{ "/images/enigma/0013.jpg"}})

Firstly, we set the dials (or rotors) of the Enigma to the correct key set that we want to use

Then we press letters on the keyboard as we would expect

The electrical signal may then go through one of the plugs on the plug board should one be present


![]({{ "/images/enigma/0016.jpg"}})

The signal will then travel through the rotors


![]({{ "/images/enigma/0017.jpg"}})

The electrical signal will travel through each rotor in turn


![]({{ "/images/enigma/0018.jpg"}})

And be reflected back again by the reflector or UKW


![]({{ "/images/enigma/0019.jpg"}})

This will in turn light a lamp, completing the elctrical connection

Now that we've got the basics in place, we can start to break it down a little more.
